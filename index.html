		<div class="intro_teen bio">

			<p id="intro_first">
			Christina Spigner was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, child to Dr. and Mrs. Bruce and Geneva Spigner.   The youngest of three children, Christina grew up admiring her two older sisters, Jessica and Michelle. She followed in their footsteps and pursued dance, piano, and gymnastics at an early age. </p>
			<img src="images/teen_little.jpg" alt="" id="teen_little">
			<p>
			Christina was brought up in a loving Christian home and had the unwavering support from her parents as her talent and passion for dance blossomed. Christina began to shine in her contemporary and ballet work and, by age 14, had a feature in the local newspaper, danced the principle role of Clara in Ballet Arizona's The Nutcracker, won three national tittles, and acquired numerous regional awards and scholarships. Additionally, she was the assistant  teacher for two national dance convention circuits for young artists. <br>
			<br>
			At age 15, Christina was given the opportunity to move to Miami to pursue an education and career in classical and neoclassical ballet. After receiving a full scholarship to attend Miami City Ballet’s school, she made the choice to leave family, friends, and home with the support of her mom and dog, Molly. The sacrifice paid off quickly and at the age of 16 Christina began performing and touring with the Miami City Ballet as a student apprentice.<br>
			<br>
			Christina is in her fourth season with the company as a Corps de Ballet member. In her first year in the corps, she was nominated for the prestigious Princess Grace award which is given to one young artist by the artistic director of a major ballet company. In her professional years following, Christina was blessed with features in several newspaper, magazine, and online articles. She has also shared her knowledge and expertise of the body, exercise, kinesiology, and nutrition with readers nationwide. She has been featured in Dance magazine, Dance Spirit magazine, Dance Teacher magazine, City & Shore magazine, and The Miami Herald. 
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			Christina's passions are not exclusive to ballet. She also has a love for Christ and youth. Christina has served with the youth ministry at her church, Christ Fellowship, for two years and is currently leading a small discipleship group of ladies from the ballet company. She also enjoys speaking to young students, especially those of color, about her experience as a professional ballerina, and encouraging and giving them hope to pursue their dance dreams and aspirations. She has spoken in schools and dance studios across South Florida and Chicago. Additionally, she participates in Miami City Ballet's outreach program, "Ballet for Young People,” which serves to expose children to the art form of classical ballet, free of admission.  <br>
			<br>
			In her down time, Christina enjoys reading the Word of God, spending quality time with family, laughing and acting silly with friends, movie nights spent in, marathons of TVs "The Office,” baking, listening to gospel tracks, traveling, and anything adventurous. She even skydives! :) <br>
			<br>
			Christina is currently living in Miami Beach, Florida and will be turning 23, March 16th. Her future aspirations include building her dance career and retiring to pursue ministry work. She also looks to teach ballet and continue speaking to schools and students nationwide.</p>
